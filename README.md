# üéâ Alphabet-Recognition - Simple Tool for Persian Alphabet Recognition

## üöÄ Getting Started

Welcome! This guide will help you download and run the **Alphabet-Recognition** app. This application recognizes Persian letters using advanced technology. You don‚Äôt need programming skills to start. Just follow these simple steps.

## üè∑Ô∏è What is Alphabet-Recognition?

**Alphabet-Recognition** is a Python script designed to identify Persian alphabet characters. It uses two powerful neural networks to deliver accurate results. The first model consists of dense layers that classify characters into 43 groups. The second model employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for enhanced image recognition. Both models have been trained and tested to ensure their performance.
